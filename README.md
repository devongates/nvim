# nvim-config
### My personal nvim config

The idea is that I use vim what it's best for: text editing without all the bloat. I'll use tmux for window management.

### Goals:
- [x] Optimized vim preferences and enhanced keybindings that make sense (i.e. disabling exiting visual mode after > or <)
- [ ] Non text-edit-related commands are prefixed by <super> and suffixed mnemonically
- [ ] A simple file explorer (may just stick with netrw)
- [ ] Linting and LSP
- [ ] Jump to char plugin (probably [easymotion](https://github.com/easymotion/vim-easymotion))
- [ ] [vim-which-key](https://github.com/liuchengxu/vim-which-key) integration
- [ ] auto close parentheses
- [ ] [vim-surround](https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround)
- [x] [gruvbox](https://github.com/ellisonleao/gruvbox.nvim) theme
- [ ] [vim-startify](https://github.com/mhinz/vim-startify) welcome screen
- [ ] use of nerdfont symbols
- [ ] copilot integration
