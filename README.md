# nvim-config
### My personal nvim config

The idea is that I use vim what it's best for: text editing without all the bloat. I'll use tmux for window management.

### Goals:
- [x] Optimized vim preferences and enhanced keybindings that make sense (i.e. disabling exiting visual mode after > or <)
- [x] Non text-edit-related commands are prefixed by <super> and suffixed mnemonically
- [x] A simple file explorer (may just stick with netrw)
- [x] Linting and LSP
- [x] Jump to char plugin (probably [hop.nvim](https://github.com/phaazon/hop.nvim))
- [x] [vim-which-key](https://github.com/folke/which-key.nvim) integration
- [x] [auto-close](https://github.com/jiangmiao/auto-pairs) parentheses
- [x] [vim-surround](https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround)
- [x] [gruvbox](https://github.com/ellisonleao/gruvbox.nvim) theme
- [ ] [vim-startify](https://github.com/mhinz/vim-startify) welcome screen
- [ ] copilot integration
